## Introduction
In this project, the creation of a database with knowledge about Sc21 was implemented and procedures and functions were written for obtaining information, as well as procedures and triggers for changing it.
Also, add procedures to the script that allow you to import and export data for each table from/to a file with a *.csv* extension. \
The *csv* file separator is specified as a parameter of each procedure.
